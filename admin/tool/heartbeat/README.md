# A heartbeat test page for Moodle

Very simple, just performs a quick check of all critical service
dependancies (filesystem, DB, caches, and sessions) and return OK

Use from a load balancer to tell whether a node is OK

Just install the plugin normally and then point your load balance
to a url like this:

http://moodle.example.com/admin/tool/heartbeat/

It will return a page with either a 200 or 503 response code and
if it fails a string for why.

By default it only performs a light check, in particular it does not
check the moodle database. To do a full check add this query param:

http://moodle.example.com/admin/tool/heartbeat/?fullcheck

This check can also be run as a CLI:

php index.php fullcheck

# A nagios cron health checker

A script croncheck is a nagios compliant checker to see if cron
or any individual tasks are failing, with configurable thresholds

This script can be either run from the web:

http://moodle.example.com/admin/tool/heartbeat/croncheck.php

Or can be run as a CLI in which case it will return in the format
expected by Nagios:

sudo -u www-data php /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/heartbeat/croncheck.php

The various thresholds can be configured with query params or cli args
see this for details:

php croncheck.php -h
