moodle-block_coursefeedback
===========================

This Block intends to give the system administrators a tool for forced evaluation of a course (or other facts).
System administrators can define a set of textual questions, which can be rated from students.
Responses are collected in course context and can be seen by trainers and non-editing trainers.
Access to the questions and the results are given by a simple block.

It differs the approach of pre-defined "Feedback" in that way, that a block can be made sticky and feedbacks are optinal for teachers (they may use it or not).

Make it sticky
==============

Since version 1.0.6. there is an option in the plugin settings, to create a global sticky instance.
It will be shown in all course main pages.
